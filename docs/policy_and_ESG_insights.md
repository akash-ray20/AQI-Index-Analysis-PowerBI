# AQI Dashboard – Policy & ESG Insights

This document presents key insights derived from the AQI Power BI dashboard, framed for **policy evaluation, ESG reporting, and environmental risk assessment**.

## 1. Persistent Air Quality Risk in Urban Regions

The dashboard indicates sustained air quality deterioration in major urban regions. For the selected state (Delhi), the average AQI remains in the **Very Unhealthy** range, with peak AQI values approaching **Hazardous levels**. This pattern suggests that air pollution is a **structural and recurring environmental risk**, rather than an episodic or seasonal anomaly.

From an ESG perspective, prolonged exposure to such AQI levels represents a **material social and health risk**, impacting workforce productivity, public health expenditure, and quality of life.

## 2. PM2.5 as a Key Environmental Risk Driver

PM2.5 consistently emerges as the **dominant pollutant** across filters. Fine particulate matter is widely recognized as one of the most harmful air pollutants due to its ability to penetrate deep into the respiratory system.

The dominance of PM2.5 highlights the need for **targeted mitigation strategies** focused on emission-intensive activities such as transportation, construction, and combustion-based energy use. This insight is critical for policy formulation and ESG risk mitigation planning.

## 3. Regional Inequality in Air Quality Outcomes

Geospatial analysis reveals clear regional disparities in air quality. Northern and central regions exhibit a higher concentration of **Unhealthy to Hazardous AQI levels**, while southern and coastal regions generally perform better.

This uneven distribution indicates that air quality outcomes are influenced by **regional industrialization patterns, population density, and climatic factors**, reinforcing the need for **region-specific policy interventions** rather than uniform national measures.

---

## 4. High Exposure to Unsafe AQI Categories

The AQI category distribution shows that a significant share of observations fall within **Unhealthy, Very Unhealthy, and Hazardous** categories. Periods classified as Good or Moderate are comparatively limited.

From a sustainability and governance standpoint, this prolonged exposure signals **elevated long-term environmental and social risk**, requiring sustained regulatory oversight and continuous monitoring.

---

## 5. Volatility with Limited Recovery in AQI Trends

Time-series analysis demonstrates frequent short-term fluctuations in AQI levels; however, values remain consistently elevated. Despite daily variability, AQI rarely returns to safe thresholds.

This behavior suggests that while meteorological factors influence short-term changes, **baseline pollution levels remain high**, indicating systemic emission challenges rather than temporary deviations.

---

## 6. City-Level Pollution Hotspots

City-level rankings reveal significant variation within states, with certain cities consistently recording higher average AQI values. These localized hotspots point to **concentrated pollution sources** and underscore the importance of **city-specific action plans** within broader state and national frameworks.

---

## 7. Overall ESG and Policy Implications

Collectively, the dashboard highlights air pollution as a **material ESG risk**, driven largely by PM2.5 emissions and characterized by regional and urban concentration. The insights support evidence-based policymaking by identifying priority regions, dominant pollutants, and severity patterns.

---

## Executive Summary

The AQI dashboard underscores persistent and high-severity air pollution across major urban and northern regions, with PM2.5 identified as the primary contributor. Air quality frequently remains within unsafe categories, signaling long-term environmental and public health risks that warrant sustained, region-specific policy intervention and ESG-focused mitigation strategies.
