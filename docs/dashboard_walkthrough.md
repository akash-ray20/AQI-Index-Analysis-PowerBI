# Dashboard Walkthrough & Analytical Insights

This document summarizes the key analytical insights derived from the AQI Power BI dashboard based on the visuals and KPIs displayed.

## 1. Air Quality Severity in Urban Regions

The dashboard indicates that major urban regions experience consistently poor air quality. For the selected state (Delhi), the average AQI is approximately 208, which falls under the **Very Unhealthy** category. The presence of a maximum AQI value close to 397 highlights extreme pollution events within the same period, suggesting that poor air quality is not limited to isolated incidents but is a recurring issue.

## 2. Dominance of PM2.5 as a Primary Pollutant

PM2.5 appears as the dominant pollutant across the selected filters. This indicates that fine particulate matter is the leading contributor to air quality degradation. Such dominance typically points to emission sources like vehicular traffic, construction activity, and combustion-related processes, all of which have significant health implications.

## 3. Regional Patterns in AQI Levels

The AQI by State map reveals a clear geographic pattern. Northern and central regions show a higher concentration of **Unhealthy**, **Very Unhealthy**, and **Hazardous** AQI levels, while southern and coastal regions generally exhibit comparatively lower AQI values. This suggests that regional factors such as population density, industrial activity, and meteorological conditions play a strong role in air quality outcomes.

## 4. Skew Toward Higher AQI Risk Categories

The AQI level distribution indicates that a large proportion of observations fall into higher-risk categories. Good and Moderate AQI levels constitute a smaller share, implying limited periods of clean air. This skew toward higher severity categories highlights sustained environmental and public health risks.

## 5. Short-Term AQI Fluctuations Over Time

The AQI trend over time visual shows frequent short-term fluctuations within a selected month. While AQI levels vary day to day, they remain consistently elevated and rarely drop into safe ranges. This pattern reflects the sensitivity of air quality to daily emission patterns and weather conditions, while also reinforcing the chronic nature of pollution.

---

## 6. Uneven City-Level Impact

City-level analysis shows notable variation in average AQI values across cities. Some cities consistently rank among the highest, indicating localized pollution hotspots rather than uniform air quality conditions across a state. This insight supports the need for targeted, city-specific mitigation strategies.

---

## 7. Overall Environmental Risk Assessment

Collectively, the KPIs, map, trend analysis, and distribution visuals indicate persistent air quality challenges driven primarily by PM2.5 pollution. The dashboard highlights where pollution is most severe, how frequently unsafe air quality occurs, and how these patterns vary across regions and time.

---

## Summary Insight

The dashboard demonstrates that air pollution remains a chronic and severe issue in major urban and northern regions, with PM2.5 as the primary driver. AQI levels frequently fall into unhealthy categories, underscoring the need for sustained and region-specific pollution control measures.
